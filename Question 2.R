# The associate dean of a business school was looking for ways to improve the quality of the
# applicants to its MBA program. In particular she wanted to know whether the undergraduate
# degree of applicants differed among her school and the three nearby universities with MBA
# programs. She sampled 100 applicants of her program and an equal number from each of the
# other universities. She recorded their undergraduate degree (1 = BA, 2 = B.Eng, 3 = BBA, and 4
#                                                              =Other) as well as the university (codes 1, 2, 3, and 4).
# Refer to the MBA.rds dataset and answer the below questions.
# a. What type of data is this?
#   b. Using R, tabulate and graph the relationship between the applicantâ€™s undergraduate degree
# and the university that applied to.
# c. Is the undergraduate degree and the university each person applied to appear to be related?
